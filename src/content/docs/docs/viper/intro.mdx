Viper is a lightweight, hacking toolkit created by Volk. Built for speed and flexibility.  
Its core strengths are:

- **Stealth-focused tools:** Because of Viper's lightweight design and stealth-focus it's harder to get detected using Viper. Viper also completely bypasses active scans when used properly.
- **Operator utilities:** Built-in session management, easy deletion, and creation of sessions.
- **Lightweight footprint:** No dependencies to avoid attracting attention and to run on a wide range of target hosts.

Viper is intended for players who prefer a toolbox-style approach: combine attack chains or craft bespoke sequences for high-value targets. Whether you’re conducting quick recon, executing a precision exploit, or maintaining covert access, Viper aims to turn complex operations into clear, manageable steps so you can focus on strategy rather than tooling.
