## What is the AI?

The **X AI Agent** is a natural language command assistant that understands what you want to do and executes terminal commands for you.

### Why Use AI?

The AI understands many different ways to express the same intent!

### What Can It Do?

- 📂 **File Operations**: Copy, move, delete, create files
- 🔐 **Permissions**: Change file permissions, owners, and groups  
- 🌐 **Network Scanning**: Scan IPs, ports, and networks
- 💻 **Exploitation**: Find and exploit vulnerabilities
- 📧 **Data Extraction**: Get emails, passwords, and files
- ⚙️ **System Management**: Search files, view contents, manage processes

---

## Getting Started

### Basic Syntax

All AI commands start with `ai` followed by your request:

```bash
ai your request here
```

**For read-only commands** (viewing, listing, searching), quotes are optional:
```bash
ai show me test.txt
ai scan 192.168.1.1
ai list files
```

**For write commands** (copying, moving, deleting, changing permissions), use quotes to be safe:
```bash
ai copy test.txt to backup.txt
ai delete oldfile.txt
ai change permissions of myfile to 644
```

### Your First Command

Let's try reading a file:

```bash
ai show me the file test.txt
```

**What happens:**
1. AI detects you want to read a file (`cat` command)
2. AI extracts the filename: `test.txt`
3. AI executes the command and shows you the contents

That's it! No need to remember command syntax.

### Help Command

Ask the AI for help with any command:

```bash
ai what does chmod do?
ai how do I use scan?
ai explain the exploit command
```

---

## Basic Commands

### Viewing Files

**Show file contents:**
```bash
ai show me myfile.txt
ai read the file config.txt
ai display document.txt
ai cat myfile.txt  # Traditional command also works
```

**View directory contents:**
```bash
ai list files in this directory
ai show me what's in Documents
ai ls  # Traditional command also works
```

### Searching

**Search for text in files:**
```bash
ai search for 'password' in config.txt
ai find the word 'admin' in logfile.txt
ai grep 'error' in system.log
```

**Find files by name:**
```bash
ai find files named test.txt
ai locate all .txt files
ai search for files containing 'backup' in the name
```

### Creating Files

**Create an empty file:**
```bash
ai create an empty file called newfile.txt
ai touch test.txt
ai make a new file named data.txt
```

**Create a directory:**
```bash
ai create a directory called MyFolder
ai make a new folder named Projects
ai mkdir TestDir
```

---

## File Operations

### Copying Files

**Basic copy:**
```bash
ai copy test.txt to backup.txt
ai duplicate myfile.txt as myfile_backup.txt
ai cp document.txt to Documents/document.txt
```

**Copy with path:**
```bash
ai copy myfile.txt to /home/user/Documents
ai duplicate test.txt to Desktop/test_copy.txt
```

**What gets copied:**
- The file itself
- File contents
- Original permissions preserved

### Moving/Renaming Files

**Move file to different location:**
```bash
ai move test.txt to Documents
ai relocate myfile.txt to Desktop
ai mv old.txt to Archive/old.txt
```

**Rename file:**
```bash
ai rename test.txt to newname.txt
ai move oldname.txt to newname.txt
ai change test.txt name to final.txt
```

**Move and rename:**
```bash
ai move myfile.txt to Documents/renamed.txt
```

### Deleting Files

**Delete a file:**
```bash
ai delete test.txt
ai remove oldfile.txt
ai erase backup.txt
ai rm unwanted.txt
```

**⚠️ Warning:** File deletion is permanent! The AI will ask for confirmation before deleting.

### Creating Links

**Create a symbolic link:**
```bash
ai create a link from source.txt to link.txt
ai make a symlink from myfile.txt to shortcut.txt
ai ln source.txt to destination.txt
```

**What is a link?**  
A link is like a shortcut. Editing the link edits the original file.

---

## Permission Management

File permissions control who can read, write, or execute files.

### Understanding Permissions

**Permission Levels:**
- **Read (r/4)**: View file contents
- **Write (w/2)**: Modify file contents  
- **Execute (x/1)**: Run file as program

**Permission Numbers:**
- `777` = Full access (read + write + execute for everyone)
- `755` = Owner can do everything, others can read and execute
- `644` = Owner can read and write, others can only read
- `444` = Read-only for everyone
- `000` = No permissions for anyone

### Changing Permissions (chmod)

**Using permission numbers:**
```bash
ai change permissions of test.txt to 755
ai set permissions of myfile.txt to 644
ai chmod test.txt to 777
```

**Using descriptions:**
```bash
ai make test.txt executable
ai give full permissions to myfile.txt
ai set test.txt to read only
ai remove all permissions from secret.txt
```

**Change permissions of X to Y patterns:**
```bash
ai change permissions of test.txt to 755
ai set permissions of myfile.txt to read only
ai chmod test.txt to 777
ai give permissions of script.sh to executable
```

**Recursive permissions (for directories):**
```bash
ai change permissions of MyFolder to 755
# AI will ask: "Apply recursively to all files inside?"
```

### Changing Owner (chown)

**Change file owner:**
```bash
ai change owner of test.txt to root
ai chown test.txt to admin
ai set owner of myfile.txt to guest
```

**Using direct pattern:**
```bash
ai chown root test.txt
```

**Recursive:**
```bash
ai change owner of MyFolder to root
# AI will ask about recursive
```

### Changing Group (chgrp)

**Change file group:**
```bash
ai change group of test.txt to admin
ai chgrp test.txt to users
ai set group of myfile.txt to developers
```

### Changing Owner and Group (chog)

**Change both at once:**
```bash
ai chog guest test.txt
ai change owner and group of test.txt to root
ai chog of myfile.txt to admin
```

---

## Network Scanning

Network scanning finds computers, open ports, and vulnerabilities.

### Basic Scanning

**Scan a specific IP:**
```bash
ai scan 192.168.1.1
ai probe 10.0.0.5
ai check 172.16.0.1 for open ports
```

**Scan with service:**
```bash
ai scan 192.168.1.1 port 22
ai check 10.0.0.5 for ssh
ai probe 192.168.1.1 on port 80
```

### Scan Flags

**Scan random IP:**
```bash
ai scan a random ip
ai scan random network
ai probe a random host
```

**Scan localhost:**
```bash
ai scan local
ai scan localhost
ai check my computer
```

**Scan local network:**
```bash
ai scan the network
ai scan lan
ai probe home network
```

### What You'll See

```
Scanning 192.168.1.1...
Found computer: 192.168.1.1
Open ports:
  22 (SSH)
  80 (HTTP)
  443 (HTTPS)
Services:
  SSH version 2.0
  Apache web server
```

**Next steps after scanning:**
- Exploit vulnerabilities
- Crack passwords
- Extract data

---

## Exploitation and Hacking

### Discrete Exploit Scanning (es)

**Scan for library exploits:**
```bash
ai scan apt library
ai check metaxploit for vulnerabilities
ai scan crypto library
```

**Scan remote service:**
```bash
ai scan ssh on 192.168.1.1
ai scan ftp on 10.0.0.5 port 21
ai check http on 192.168.1.100
```

**What is es?**  
`es` (exploit scan) is a discrete scanning tool that:
- Checks local libraries for exploits
- Scans remote services for vulnerabilities
- Quieter than normal scan

### Finding Exploits

**After scanning:**
```bash
ai find exploits for this computer
ai show available exploits
ai what vulnerabilities exist?
```

### Executing Exploits

**Exploit a target:**
```bash
ai exploit 192.168.1.1
ai attack this computer
ai break into this system
```

**What happens:**
1. AI scans for vulnerabilities
2. Finds available exploits
3. Executes most promising exploit
4. Returns shell or file access

### Cracking Passwords

**Crack a password file:**
```bash
ai crack the password file
ai brute force passwords
ai crack user passwords
```

**Crack specific user:**
```bash
ai crack password for root
ai brute force admin password
```

### Privilege Escalation

**Escalate to root access:**
```bash
ai escalate to root
ai get root access
ai escalate privileges
```

**What happens:**
```
Agent: Understood - Execute cal command for root access
Agent: Executing plan...
NOVEMBER-( 2005 )

Done. Awaiting further instructions.
```

The AI uses the `cal` command to gain root privileges on the target system.

---

## Data Extraction

After gaining access to a system, extract valuable data.

### Router Data (dig)

**Extract email data:**
```bash
ai extract email data
ai dig for emails
ai get mail from router
```

**Extract banking data:**
```bash
ai extract bank information
ai dig for banking data
ai get financial records
```

**Extract passwords:**
```bash
ai extract passwords
ai dig for password file
ai get user credentials
```

**Extract all data:**
```bash
ai extract everything
ai dig all data from router
ai get all available information
```

### Shell Data

**List files:**
```bash
ai list files on this computer
ai show directory contents
```

**Download files:**
```bash
ai download /etc/passwd
ai get the password file
```

---

## Configuration

The AI has settings you can change.

### Output Level

**Control verbosity:**
```bash
ai verbose mode on      # Show detailed logs
ai verbose mode off     # Normal output
ai quiet mode on        # Minimal output
ai quiet mode off       # Normal output
```

**Or set directly:**
```bash
ai set outputLevel to 2  # 0=silent, 1=normal, 2=verbose
```

### Dry Run Mode

**Preview commands without executing:**
```bash
ai dry run on           # Preview mode
ai dry run off          # Execute mode
```

**Example:**
```bash
ai dry run on
ai delete test.txt
# AI shows: "Would execute: rm test.txt" (but doesn't delete)
```

### Aggressive Mode

**Enable aggressive exploitation:**
```bash
ai aggressive mode on
ai aggressive mode off
```

**What it does:**
- Tries all exploits instead of safest one
- Uses brute force when possible
- Reduces delays between attempts

### Stealth Mode

**Minimize detection:**
```bash
ai stealth mode on
ai stealth mode off
```

**What it does:**
- Uses slower, quieter scanning
- Randomizes attack timing
- Clears logs when possible

### Debug Mode

**Show technical details:**
```bash
ai debug mode on
ai debug mode off
```

**Use when:**
- Commands aren't working as expected
- You want to see what AI is thinking
- Reporting bugs

### View Configuration

**See current settings:**
```bash
ai show config
ai display configuration
ai view settings
```

**Reset to defaults:**
```bash
ai reset config
ai restore default settings
```

---

## Natural Language Tips

### The AI Understands Many Phrasings

**Same command, different words:**
```bash
ai show me test.txt
ai display test.txt
ai read test.txt
ai cat test.txt
ai view the contents of test.txt
ai let me see test.txt
```

All of these do the same thing!

### Use Natural Sentences

**You can be conversational:**
```bash
ai can you show me the file test.txt?
ai I need to see what's in myfile.txt
ai please scan the local network
```

### Command Names Work Too

**If you know the command name:**
```bash
ai chmod test.txt to 755"
ai grep 'password' in config.txt"
ai scan 192.168.1.1
```

### Case Doesn't Matter

**Filenames preserve case, but commands don't:**
```bash
ai SHOW ME TEST.TXT"      # Works, but filename becomes uppercase
ai Show Me test.txt"      # Preserves test.txt case
ai show me TeSt.TxT"      # Preserves TeSt.TxT case
```

**Best practice:** Use normal capitalization for filenames.

---

## Common Patterns

### "of X to Y" Pattern

Many commands use "of X to Y" structure:

```bash
ai change permissions of test.txt to 755"
ai change owner of test.txt to root"
ai change group of test.txt to admin"
ai move content of source.txt to dest.txt"
```

### Direct Pattern

Some commands support direct structure:

```bash
ai chmod test.txt to 755"           # Direct
ai chown root test.txt"             # Direct
ai chgrp admin test.txt"            # Direct
```

### "X into Y" Pattern

For copy/archive operations:

```bash
ai copy test.txt into backup.txt"
ai move myfile.txt into Archive"
ai tar myfiles into backup.tar"
```

### Flag-Based Commands

Some commands use flags instead of targets:

```bash
ai scan random"              # Uses -r flag
ai scan local"               # Uses -l flag
ai scan network"             # Uses -n flag
ai list wifi networks"       # Uses iwlist -l
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not recognized"

**Problem:** AI doesn't understand your request.

**Solutions:**
1. Be more specific: "show file" → "show me test.txt"
2. Use command name: "chmod test.txt to 755"
3. Try different wording: "display" instead of "show"

### "No target specified"

**Problem:** AI knows what command but not which file/IP.

**Solutions:**
1. Include the target: "scan 192.168.1.1" not just "scan"
2. Be explicit: "delete test.txt" not just "delete"

### "Permission denied"

**Problem:** You don't have rights to perform action.

**Solutions:**
1. Check if you're root: `whoami`
2. Escalate privileges if you have a shell
3. Use AI to escalate: "ai escalate to root"

### Wrong File Case

**Problem:** File not found because case is wrong.

**Example:**
```bash
ai show me MYFILE.TXT
# Looks for MYFILE.TXT but file is actually MyFile.txt
```

**Solution:** Use exact case:
```bash
ai show me MyFile.txt
```

### Command Did Something Unexpected

**Problem:** AI interpreted your request differently than intended.

**Solutions:**
1. Enable dry run first: `ai dry run on"`
2. Be more specific in your request
3. Use the exact command name if you know it

**Example of being more specific:**
```bash
# Ambiguous
ai remove permissions"  # Could mean chmod or rm!

# Clear
ai remove all permissions from test.txt"  # chmod
ai delete the file test.txt"              # rm
```

### AI is Too Slow

**Problem:** Commands take a long time.

**Causes:**
- Reading man pages (first time only)
- Complex operations (scanning networks)
- Waiting for user prompts

**Solutions:**
1. Disable prompts: `ai promptOnAmbiguous off"`
2. Use simple commands when possible
3. Be patient during network operations

## Advanced Tips

### Chaining Commands

You can execute multiple AI commands in sequence:

```bash
ai scan 192.168.1.1 && ai exploit 192.168.1.1"
```

### Using Variables

Store results for later use:

```bash
TARGET="192.168.1.1"
ai scan $TARGET"
ai exploit $TARGET"
```

### Aliases

Create shortcuts for common AI commands:

```bash
alias aiscan='ai scan'
alias aiexploit='ai exploit'

# Usage
aiscan 192.168.1.1
aiexploit 192.168.1.1
```

### Scripting

Put AI commands in scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto_hack.sh

echo "Starting automated hack..."

ai scan 192.168.1.1
ai exploit 192.168.1.1"
ai escalate to root"
ai extract all data"

echo "Hack complete!"
```

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with basic commands:
- View files
- List directories
- Simple searches

Then progress to:
- Scanning
- Exploitation
- Data extraction

### 2. Use Dry Run

Before destructive operations:
```bash
ai dry run on"
ai delete important_file.txt"
# Check if this is what you want
ai dry run off"
```

### 3. Enable Verbose Mode

When learning:
```bash
ai verbose mode on"
```

This shows you:
- What the AI is doing
- Which commands are executed
- Detailed progress

### 4. Be Specific

**Vague:**
```bash
ai "scan"  # Scan what?
```

**Specific:**
```bash
ai scan 192.168.1.1
```

### 5. Save Your Work

After successful commands:
```bash
ai create a file called commands.txt
# Note: Manually save your command history
```

### 6. Read Output Carefully

The AI provides helpful information:
- Confirmation messages
- Error details
- Next step suggestions

### 7. Experiment Safely

Use non-critical files for testing:
```bash
ai create an empty file called test.txt
ai change permissions of test.txt to 777
ai delete test.txt
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Using Quotes for Complex Commands

**Most commands work fine without quotes:**
```bash
ai show me test.txt  # Works!
ai scan 192.168.1.1  # Works!
```

**But use quotes for complex write operations to be safe:**
```bash
ai "copy file with spaces.txt to backup folder/file.txt"
ai delete important file.txt
```

### Mistake 2: Wrong File Case

**Wrong:**
```bash
ai show me MYFILE.TXT
# But file is actually MyFile.txt
```

**Right:**
```bash
ai show me MyFile.txt
```

### Mistake 3: Missing Target

**Wrong:**
```bash
ai "scan"
# Error: No target specified
```

**Right:**
```bash
ai scan 192.168.1.1
```

### Mistake 4: Confusing Commands

**Wrong:**
```bash
ai remove permissions"
# Unclear: Delete file or remove permissions?
```

**Right:**
```bash
ai remove all permissions from test.txt"  # chmod
ai delete the file test.txt"              # rm
```

### Mistake 5: Not Checking Before Deleting

**Wrong:**
```bash
ai delete *.txt"
# Deletes ALL .txt files!
```

**Right:**
```bash
ai dry run on"
ai delete *.txt"
# Check what would be deleted
ai dry run off"
# Then delete if okay
```

## Getting Help

### Ask the AI

```bash
ai help
ai what commands are available?"
ai how do I use scan?"
ai explain chmod
```

### Check Configuration

```bash
ai show config"
ai display current settings"
```

### Enable Debug Mode

```bash
ai debug mode on"
# Run your problematic command
ai show me test.txt"
# Look at debug output for clues
```

### Read Error Messages

The AI provides helpful error messages:

```
Agent: No target specified for scan
```

This tells you: You need to specify what to scan!

```
Agent: File not found: test.txt
```

This tells you: The file doesn't exist or wrong case!
