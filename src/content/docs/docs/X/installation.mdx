# X Setup Instructions
## Getting Your Nopass X Up and Running

This guide will help you set up X with rainbow tables and the exploit database.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Core Packages

Run these installation commands in order:

```bash
apt-get install x /home/USER_HOME
apt-get install exploits /home/USER_HOME
apt-get install bash /home/USER_HOME
apt-get install man /home/USER_HOME
apt-get install passwords /home/USER_HOME
```

### 2. Initial Setup

**Run X at least once**, then execute the following commands in any order:

```bash
exploits
bash
man
passwords
```

### 3. Initialize Rainbow Tables

Initialize your password lists and rainbow tables:

```bash
rainbow -n
```

If not prompted, enable rainbow indexing on startup:

```bash
config -p
```

### 4. AI Learning (Optional)

If you plan to use the AI agent, speed up learning by having it read all man pages:

```bash
ai learn all
```

### 5. System Check

Verify and auto-install required core libraries:

```bash
sys check
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be run from main session
- Requires internet connection
- Auto-installs: `crypto.so`, `metaxploit.so`, `aptclient.so`, `librshell.so`

This ensures X has all necessary components to function properly.

### 6. Configure Root Bounce Library (Optional)

If you're using a root bounce library, configure it:

```bash
# Set the bounce library (can be short like "http", "ssh", etc.)
config -v bounce_lib

# Set the exploit index
config -x

# Add library to saved libs
libs -a /path/to/library.so
```

### 7. Backup Your Database

**Important:** Make regular backups of your database - bad things happen!

```bash
exp backup
```

## About the Bash Scripts

The included bash scripts demonstrate how X's macro/bash system works:

- Most scripts are usable out of the box
- Some require a working exploit database
- Use them as learning examples for creating your own scripts

---

## Maintaining X

Once X is set up correctly, it becomes a powerful operation script. However, **X requires regular maintenance** to keep the database updated.

### Database Maintenance Commands

Run these regularly to keep your exploit database current:

```bash
pacman exp router
pacman -Sy -e -c 100
```

**For weekly maintenance**, use a higher count:

```bash
pacman -Sy -e -c 1000
```

### Security Best Practices

**Always use @proxy** after you have a working database and before attacking systems.

---

## Getting Help

### Built-in Help

- **List commands**: Type `?`, `cmd`, or `help` from any object
- **Man pages**: Most commands have documentation - `man <command>`
- **RTFM**: Read the manual pages for detailed information

### Community Support

If you need help getting X up and running (and can stream):

- **Discord**: DM `AwETux`
- **Server**: Viper Discord - https://discord.gg/qCgGUKhX7m

## Important Notes

### User Privileges

⚠️ **X should be used as a user and not run as root.**

- Running as root may cause unknown issues
- If you choose to run as root, be aware of potential problems

### File Permissions

- You can `chmod` your `/` filesystem if needed
- **Payload must be 755** to work correctly

### For New Players

If you are a new player or have little to no experience with Linux:

**Consider using Doom instead of X**

X is a powerful but complex tool that requires Linux knowledge and regular maintenance.
