GSSE (GreyScript Script Extender) is a lightweight extension library that enhances the built-in GreyScript language with a collection of practical, well-tested helper functions. Designed to be dropped into existing projects with minimal hassle, GSSE fills common gaps in the default runtime by providing utilities for string manipulation, table handling, math helpers, timing and parsers.

Key benefits
- **Familiar:** Functions use GreyScript idioms and minimal ceremony so they feel native.
- **Practical:** Focused on everyday needs—parsing, formatting, data transformation, and robustness helpers.
- **Composable:** Small, focused utilities that compose cleanly with each other and user code.
- **Non-invasive:** Adds functions without changing core language behavior or requiring custom changes.

What’s included
- **String helpers** (formatters, colors and strippers)
- **Table utilities** (list cleaner and value checker)
- **Math and random helpers** (crypto functions, base64, power, seeded RNG)
- **Timing** (2 way epoch time converter)

Getting started
1. Drop the GSSE module into your project.

This documentation covers installation, API reference with usage examples, migration tips from vanilla GreyScript patterns, and recommended best practices for keeping scripts maintainable while leveraging GSSE.
