import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note">All libraries are imported with the permissions of the user that imported the libraries, for maximum permissions import as root.</Aside>
<Aside type="tip">By default metaxploit calculations are done from the selected library, however specifying the variable `lib` using the [addvar](/guides/viper/commands/addvar/) command with the index of the library you want to use for calculations will overwrite this ex: `addvar lib 0`. This is especially useful for routers where calculations are slow. But can also be used to not damage your own hardware.</Aside>

### Purpose
Select a library.

```bash
uselib [INDEX]
```

### Arguments
- INDEX -- specify the library index from the [libs](/guides/viper/commands/libs/) command

### Examples
```bash
uselib 0
```
Results:  
*Selected library of index 0*
